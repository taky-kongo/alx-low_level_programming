This repository is intended for use in learning ALX C programming.

0x00-hello_world: We see the basics of C programming. We learn how to compile a C file. We learn how to handle the gcc compiler on the command line.

0x01-variables_if_else_while: In this project, we have seen the different variables, the "if", "else", "else if" conditions and the while loop.

0x02-functions_nested_loops: We have seen the loops and their use. Also, we have seen functions and how to use them. The difference between a function and the definition of function. Finally, we have seen header files and how to use them with #include.

0x03-debugging: We have seen the concepts and processes of manual debugging.

0x04-more_functions_nested_loops: We deepen our knowledge of the functions.

0x05-pointers_arrays_strings: In this project we see arrays, strings and pointers.

0x06-pointers_arrays_strings: In this project, we see more arrays, strings and pointers.

0x07-pointers_arrays_strings: In this project, we see pointers to pointers, two-dimensional arrays and how to manipulate them and find their address.

0x09-static_libraries: In this project, we see:

	* a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
	* Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm

0x0A-argc_argv: In this project, wee see:

	* How to use arguments passed to your program
	* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
	* How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

0x0B-malloc_free: In this project, we see:

	* The difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
	* What is malloc and free and how to use them
	* Why and when use malloc
	* How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

0x0C-more_malloc_free: In this project, we see:

	* How to use the exit function
	* What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them

	* What are structures, when, why and how to use them
	* How to use typedef

0x0F-function_pointers: In this project, we see:
	
	* What are function pointers and how to use them
	* What does a function pointer exactly hold
	* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

0x10-variadic_functions: In this project, we see:

	* What are variadic functions
	* How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
	* Why and how to use the const type qualifier

0x12-singly_linked_lists: In this project, we see:

	* When and why using linked lists vs arrays
	* How to build and use linked lists

0x15-file_io: In this project, we see:

	* Look for the right source of information online
	* How to create, open, close, read and write files
	* What are file descriptors
	* What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
	* How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
	* What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
	* What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
