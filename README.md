This repository is intended for use in learning ALX C programming.

0x00-hello_world: We see the basics of C programming. We learn how to compile a C file. We learn how to handle the gcc compiler on the command line.

0x01-variables_if_else_while: In this project, we have seen the different variables, the "if", "else", "else if" conditions and the while loop.

0x02-functions_nested_loops: We have seen the loops and their use. Also, we have seen functions and how to use them. The difference between a function and the definition of function. Finally, we have seen header files and how to use them with #include.

0x03-debugging: We have seen the concepts and processes of manual debugging.

0x04-more_functions_nested_loops: We deepen our knowledge of the functions.

0x05-pointers_arrays_strings: In this project we see arrays, strings and pointers.

0x06-pointers_arrays_strings: In this project, we see more arrays, strings and pointers.

0x07-pointers_arrays_strings: In this project, we see pointers to pointers, two-dimensional arrays and how to manipulate them and find their address.

0x08-recursion: In this project, we have seen recursion and how to implement it.

0x09-static_libraries: In this project we see the static libraries. We see their use and their importance.

0x0A-argc_argv: In this project we have seen the arguments of the main function and how to use them. Also we saw how to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

0x0B-malloc_free: In this project, we see the dynamic speeches. The difference between automatic and dynamic speech.
We study, valgrind, malloc and free.

0x0C-more_malloc_free: In this project, we see the dynamic speeches. How to allocate memory with the malloc and calloc function. Also, we see the realloc function, the free function and the exit function.

0x0D-preprocessor: In this project, we see the preprocessors, macros and dynamic links

0x0E-structures_typedef: In this project, we see struct and typedef and how to use them.

0x10-variadic_functions: In this project, we see the variadic functions and the constants and how to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros.
