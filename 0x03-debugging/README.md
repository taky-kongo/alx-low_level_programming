0-main.c: This file should test that the positive_or_negative() function gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

1-main.c: Fixed the part of the code that causes the output in an infinite loop by commenting it.

2-largest_number: Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
