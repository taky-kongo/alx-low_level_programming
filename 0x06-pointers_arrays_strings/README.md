0-strcat.c: This program is a function that concatenates two strings.

	* Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
	* This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
	* Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

1-strncat.c: This program is a function that concatenates two strings.

	* Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
	* The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
	* it will use at most n bytes from src; and
	* src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
	* Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

2-strncpy.c: This program is a function that copies a string.

	* Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
	* Your function should work exactly like strncpy

3-strcmp.c: This program is a function that compares two strings.

	* Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
	* Your function should work exactly like strcmp

4-rev_array.c: This program is a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

	* Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);
	* Where n is the number of elements of the array

5-string_toupper.c: This program is a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

	* Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);
